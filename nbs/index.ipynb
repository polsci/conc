    "Conc is a Python library that brings corpus linguistic analysis to [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/). A staple of data science, [Jupyter notebooks are a great model for presenting analysis](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook) through an interactive form that combines code, reporting and discussion that allows other researchers to reproduce and interact with your analysis. Conc aims to allow researchers to analyse large corpora in efficient ways using standard hardware, with the ability to produce clear, publication-ready reports and extend analysis where required using standard Python libraries.\n",

    "* use fast code libraries (i.e. Conc uses [Polars vs Pandas](https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks/) and fast data structures (e.g. Numpy arrays, columnar data stores)   \n",
