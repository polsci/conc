    "Conc is a Python library that brings tools for corpus linguistic analysis to [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/). Conc aims to allow researchers to analyse large corpora in efficient ways using standard hardware, with the ability to produce clear, publication-ready reports and extend analysis where required using standard Python libraries.  \n",

    "A staple of data science, [Jupyter notebooks allow researchers to present their analysis in an interactive form that combines code, reporting and discussion](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook). They are an ideal format for collaborating with other researchers during research or to share analysis in a way others can reproduce and interact with. \n",

    "Conc uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for tokenising texts. SpaCy functionality to annotate texts will be supported soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conc uses well-supported Python libraries for processing data and prioritises fast code libraries and data structures. The library produces clear reports with important information to interpret result by default. Conc makes it easy to extend analysis using other libraries or software. [Conc's corpus format is well-documented](https://geoffford.nz/conc/explanations/anatomy.html) and there are [code examples to help you work with Conc results and data structures outside of Conc](https://geoffford.nz/conc/tutorials/recipes.html)  if you want to extend your analysis. \n",

You can also [install the development version](https://geoffford.nz/conc/tutorials/install.html#install-the-development-version) of Conc, which may include new functionality and bug fixes. If you want to download sample corpora you will need to [install optional dependencies](https://geoffford.nz/conc/tutorials/install.html#install-optional-dependencies). If you have an older computer with a pre-2013 CPU, you will probably need to install a version of Polars compiled for older machines, see the [install page for details](https://geoffford.nz/conc/tutorials/install.html#pre-2013-cpu-install-polars-with-support-for-older-machines)."
